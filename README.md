Coding for learning machine learning 

clt.py
------

1. General central limit theorem from random number selection 
2. Gauss histogram
3. Central limit theorem shown by taking one flat samples and one exponential samples . 

You can run it in linux by typing 

               `         python clt.py`

and in windows just install python ide from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and open it and press run .

fft.m
-----

Fourier transfor graphs in Matlab for 

              `3*sin(t) + cos(2*t) - 2*sin(3*t) + 0.2*cos(10*t) - sin(2*t)`
